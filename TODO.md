## Design Patterns 
##### csrMatrix
	* Construct builder design pattern on construction on matrix: https://github.com/nslocum/design-patterns-in-ruby
	* Build iterator design pattern for Ruby
	* MUST ADD Abstract Factory and Delegate design patterns to code

##### Arithmetic
	* Produce a new matrix after processing - can use with composite design pattern

##### Decompositions
	* Complete decompositions

##### Functions


##### Helpers


##### Operations
	* Add comments to operators

##### Properties
	* Replace Matrix library use with actual processing of values
	* Pull specific values (possibly via iterator function? pull each non-zero value, iterate over these)

## Other
	* Delete basicMatrix
	* Clean up the document to be sent on Feb. 3
	* Produce comments, in the structure of RDoc
	* Add exceptions! 

## FUNCTIONS TO ADD:
	* LUP / Decomposition
	* Iterator / pull specific values from matrix
	* Alternative build methods
	* Maybe constructing using imaginary numbers?
